# Deep Society
 Deep Society is a gateway that creates new ways for us to connect with people around us and understand them better.
 
## Inspiration
Wouldn't it be cool to have a personal assistant at your fingertips that answers your every question and doubt? Well, here is Bob™ and Friends; they are extraordinarily educated and highly resourceful. Whatever you ask them, they'll reply!

## What it does
To be filled.

## How we built it
We used Flutter to build the Frontend, along with speech recognition and speech synthesis to allow for a seamless conversion between text to speech and vice versa. Moreover, the Backend was developed in Flask and deployed to Google Cloud Platform. The question answering system was a Generative-Adversarial-Network and a Transformer model to predict the next token given a prompt (GPT-3).

## Challenges we ran into
Initially, we faced roadblocks when deploying our Backend to GCP where some endpoints randomly wouldn't return anything. Also, text to speech (TTS) was a pain to make it work properly and not sound robotic. Nevertheless, caffeine prevailed and were able to minimize most of the challenges that we ran into and release Bob™ and Friends to the public.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A fully-functional application that has thought-provoking conversations with AI bots.

## What we learned
Training ML models from scratch is hard, and in a hackathon its impossible. Always use pre-trained models!

## What's next for Deep Society
- A new DLC personal assistant for Bob™ and Friends (spoiler alert: it will be Charlie!).
- Expand the domain of Deep Society to more than just Society and Cultures; the personal assistants are not limited to the current scope.
